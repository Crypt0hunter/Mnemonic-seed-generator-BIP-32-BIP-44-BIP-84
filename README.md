# Mnemonic (12 words seed) GPU-generator BIP-32, BIP-44, BIP-84

This program can generate all the well-known types of bitcoin addresses (starting on 1, bc1q - Legacy, Segwit), according to the most common path of derivation BIP 32, BIP 44, BIP 84 using the GPU and checks them with the available addresses from database of bitcoins with balances. The program due to the calculation at the GPU has a very high speed, exceeds the CPU Generator at 100-1000x, the search takes milliseconds.

This is amazing speed vs CPU type generators, them get only 100-5000 mnemonics per second.

# WHY MNEMONIC SEED, NOT GENERATION PRIVKEY IN 256 BITS RANGE?

Just look to this picture - this is very small range from 1 to 2^132 then range for legacy btc addresses 1 to 2^256. And also important - when we searching mnemonic we find master key for all next addresses by this mnemonic words, when we searching privkey in HEX we find only one address! 

The Programm Crypt0Hunt 1.0 supported most types path of desktop and mobile wallets as Trust wallet, Exodus wallet, etc. Ledger and Trezor which using 12 words without passphrase.

We can add the functions and tools you need (other derivation paths, different coins BCH, ETH, Doge, Litecoin etc.). You will be provided with up-to-date address databases.
